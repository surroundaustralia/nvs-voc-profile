Model additions/changes
-----------------------

VOCABULARY

* implement vocab-level labels (prefLabel, altLabel) just as per Concept labels (e.g. language tags)

* replace http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment with skos:definition
    - consistent with Concept

* ensure vocabulary skos:definition properties have language tags

* use multiple, language-differentiated skos:definition for their purpose, not a rdfs:comment and skos:altLabel pair, as per P28

* remove http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative since you also use skos:altLabel

* introduce versioning properties to link between numbered vocab versions, as per Concept

* governance range values
    <http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/grg/RE_RegisterManager>
    <http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/grg/RE_RegisterOwner>
    - range values should be URIs (from C75), not literals. VocPrez can display hyperlinked text for ease of use.
    - recommended Agent structure:

    [  # or <gmon@bodc.ac.uk>
      a owl:NamedIndividual ;
      a sdo:Person ;
      sdo:affiliation <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/C75/current/BOD/> ;
      sdo:email <mailto:gmon@bodc.ac.uk> ;
      sdo:honorificPrefix "Dr"
      sdo:name "Gwenaelle Moncoiffe" ;
    ]

      not:
        [ <http://purl.org/linked-data/registry#name> "Gwenaelle Moncoiffe" ;
          <http://purl.org/linked-data/registry#title> "Dr" ;
          <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#memberOf> "http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/C75/current/BOD/"
        ] .

      and for orgs:
        <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/C75/current/BOD/>
            a skos:Concept , sdo:GovernmentOrganization ;
            sdo:name "British Oceanographic Data Centre" ;
            sdo:url <https://www.bodc.ac.uk> ;
        .

CONCEPT

* add a dct:identifier property to each Collection & ConceptScheme
    - as per Concept-level use
    - NVS is reliant on and often discusses/communicates Collection & Concept Scheme "ID" (identifier)
    - SKOS and RDF/OWL is reliant on URIs for identifiers
    - currently there is no data link between a Collection / Concept Scheme and its identifier: it is only inferred by pattern matching the URI
    - SKOS / Dublin Core and other recommendations for associating toke / slug / string identifiers with nodes is to use a property such as dct:identifier or adms:identifier
        - dct:identifier should be used for the simple case, <> dct:identifier "...". adms:identifier is an ObjectProperty for use when multiple identifiers are expected. Not relevant for NVS


* change Collection / Concept Scheme dates
    - dc:date is ambiguous - dct:created / dct:modified?
    - pav:authoredOn is ambiguous
        - PAV: "The date of creation of the resource representation."
        - PAV: "pav:lastUpdateOn can be used to indicate minor updates that did not affect the creating date"
    - recommendation:
        - change the property indicating dc:date / pav:authoredOn to dct:modified
            - at the Collection / Concept Scheme level, dcterms:modified should equal the latest Concept dcterms:modified value
        - seek a vocabulary's / Concept's first version's first dc:date to include in vocab metadata as dct:created
    - don't use dcterms:issued as this implied a more workflow/approval created date than I think you're trying to convey


* convert all instances of the token dc: to dcterms:
    - dc: is ambiguous - could be Dublin Core Terms or Elements
    - dce: (for Elements) is unusual!
    - remove duplicative properties e.g. http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier (for Concepts)


* accepted / deprecated filter documentation
    - in documentation, indicate the SPARQL query equivalent to the functions  performed by requests to URIs used to filter Concepts by owl:deprecated 
    - there are potentially many filters that could be used and showing the SPARQL logic will indicate that people can filter however thy like, not just by using the accepted / deprecated filter URIs


* link Concepts back to Collections
    - Collections link to the Concepts within them (skos:member)
    - ConceptSchemes link to Concpets within them (skos:hasTopConcept -> skos:narrower)
        - Concepts in ConceptScheme link back (skos:topConceptOf / skos:inScheme)
    - recommend dcterms:isPartOf
        - very little "ontological commitment" with this property
        - you already use dcterms:


* change datatype for owl:deprecated from string to boolean
    - <> owl:deprecated "true" . -> <> owl:deprecated true .
        - Turtle spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#grammar-production-BooleanLiteral, no "

* status markers:
    - replace <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#note> as the property indicating status with:
        - http://www.opengis.net/def/metamodel/ogc-na/status
        - http://purl.org/linked-data/registry#status
            - use values from "Register Item status values" (http://www.opengis.net/def/status)
        - http://def.isotc211.org/iso19135/-1/2015/CoreModel#RE_ItemStatus
            - "submitted", "valid", "superseded", "retired", "invalid" only
    (as done with provenance Statements)

* change ISO URIs
    - where do URIs like http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/grg/* come from?
        - http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/grg/RE_RegisterManager -> http://def.isotc211.org/iso19135/-1/2015/CoreModel#Register.manager
        - http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/grg/RE_RegisterOwner -> http://def.isotc211.org/iso19135/-1/2015/CoreModel#Register.owner



* change datatype for http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo to int
    - you convey ordering with versionInfo, e.g. 1, 2, 3 - this is an integer property, not a string property (e.g. "35" < "4" but 35 > 4)


* remove owl:versionInfo at the Concept level
    - OWL definition is "The annotation property that provides version information for an ontology or another OWL construct."
    - it is *allowed* to be used for any rdfs:Resource but it's *usually* used at the whole

* dual-characterise the NERC VoID dataset as a DCAT2 Dataset
    - this will assist with cataloguing

* create a better Dataset URI for the dataset
    - Concepts are indicates as being within a void:Dataset with the void:inDataset property
    - the Dataset is identified with the URL http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/.well-known/void
    - within the dataset, the vocabs dataset is indicated as http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/# - a bad URI!
    - recommendation:
        - create a PID URI for the dataset, e.g. http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/dataset/vocabs
        - either redirect to /.well-known/ link for the dataset via URI redirects or provide it as a dcat:distribution detail (preferred)


* Correct some vocab's references to members
    - vocabs such as S01 & P01 incorrectly reference members like this:
        <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#member>
                <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S01/current/S015/#I1460594>
                ...
                <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S01/current/S015/#I1465899>

    - URIs of the form <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/{VOCAB_ID}}/current/{CONCEPT_ID}/#I{NUMBER}> refer to rdf:Statement instances, not skos:Concept instances
    - recommend: use the URIs of concepts (i.e. no #i{NUMBER}):
            <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#member>
                <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S01/current/S015/>
                ...
                <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S01/current/S015/>


PROVENANCE

* restructure provenance
    - currently reified provenance exists for Concept relations (e.g, skos:narrower) but the reifying Statement is linked to the Concept only by a pattern-matched URI, no properties
    - the reifying Statement is then linked to another, redundant, provenance Statement via prov:has_provenance

    <Concept> ... <Concept#ID> (an rdf:Statement)
    <Concept#ID> prov:has_provenance <Statement2>

    e.g. <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S01/current/S0111/>, <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S01/current/S0111/#I1473648>, <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/mapping/I/1473648/>

    - there is no way to discover provenance via SPARQL queries

    - recommend: remove the intermediate Statement altogether
        <Concept> prov:has_provenance <Statement2>

* some predicate references are incorrect with a typo
    - e.g. for <http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/mapping/I/1460594/>
        <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower/> <-- extra trailing slash
